# SlideBall

The solution is receiving two params to specify the level and the number of balls. in my case , it's 4 but it could be any deeper or shallower.

It first initialize a tree structure and corresponding containers depends on depth. Then runs balls through the tree and fall into container. the container has unique name which composed of the parent gate name and the switch.

There are two test methods which set up initialize the tree structure and run the balls and test the expect results.
